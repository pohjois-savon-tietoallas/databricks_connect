**Description:** Instructions for installing and configuring Databricks connect <br>
**Author:** Eric Le Tortorec, Jani Miettinen<br>

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE)
```


# Background
These instructions are for installing and configuring Databricks Connect in order to access Databricks from your local computer. Sorry Windows users, the installation is more complicated for you and will require admin privileges.

**NOTE**  
Once everything has been installed and is running the results that are returned from your analyses will be downloaded onto your computer. Therefore it is absolutely forbidden to analyse KUH data using Databricks Connect!

# Cluster setup
Create a Spark cluster with Databricks Runtime version 5.5 or 6.1 and above.

If you are using Databricks Runtime 5.3 or below (unsupported), click the Spark tab and add the following Spark conf: spark.databricks.service.server.enabled true

# Client setup

## Install Java

Download and install [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html), which is the only Java version supported by Spark. **NOTE** you have to create an account at Oracle in order to download the installation file.

**Windows users**. Java will try to install itself into the `Program Files`-directory. Path has a space in it, which will cause problems. Install it in `C:\\Java` instead. You might also have to set the `JAVA_HOME` variable, more information [here.](https://datathirst.net/blog/2019/4/20/setup-databricks-connect-on-windows)

## Install Python

Download and install Python. It is easiest to install Python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Anaconda includes a environment management system called conda, which should be used to create a new environment inside which you can install the packages needed for Databricks connect.

The minor version of your client Python installation must be the same as the minor Python version of your Azure Databricks cluster (2.7, 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7). Databricks Runtime 5.x has Python 3.5, Databricks Runtime 5.x ML has Python 3.6, and Databricks Runtime 6.x and Databricks Runtime 6.x ML have Python 3.7.

**Windows users**. Anaconda comes with a command line interface called Anaconda Powershell Prompt.  Use this to write the code blocks below, unless otherwise instructed.  

**Mac users**. You can use the terminal to write the commands.

Create the environment with:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
conda create --name dbconnect python=3.7
```

Where `dbconnect` is the name of the environment and `python=3.7` specifies the version of Python you want to install.

Activate the environment with:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
conda activate dbconnect
```

Once inside the new environment configure the environment for Databricks connect. If pyspark has been installed in your environment you will need to uninstall it:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
pip uninstall pyspark
```

Then install the Databricks Connect client:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
pip install -U databricks-connect==6.2.*
```

Where `databricks-connect==6.2.*` is the Databricks Runtime version

# Get connection values
In order to connect to Databricks running on Azure, you will need specific information about the cluster you will be connecting to: 

* Databricks host
* Cluster ID
* Organisation ID
* Port
* User token

This information can be found from the URL of your cluster. E.g.:

https://northeurope.azuredatabricks.net/?o=2208xxxxxxxxxxxx#/setting/clusters/0212-yyyyyy-yyyyyyyy/

- In this case the **Databricks host** is https://northeurope.azuredatabricks.net  (The host will change when the KUH cloud environment is moved to West Europe.)

- The **cluster ID** is: 0212-yyyyyy-yyyyyyyy

- The **organisation ID** is the part after ?o= in this case: 2208xxxxxxxxxxxx

- The **port** will be 15001 by default

Finally, a **user token** needs to be created. Click on the user profile icon in the upper right had corner of the Databricks website, click on **User Settings** and then the **Access Tokens** tab. From there you can create a token, give some information about it in the form of a comment, and spaecify a lifetime. Copy the created token and store it securely.

**NOTE**  
This is like a password, treat it as such!

# Configure connection settings
Within the Python environment you created before run the following in order to supply the configuration values:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
databricks-connect configure
```

You will be presented with a license to accept and then fields in which to supply the values gathered above.

You should now be able to test the connection with:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
databricks-connect test
```

**NOTE**  
I was not able to get this to work even though the connection worked through RStudio. I read about the same experience elsewhere as well. Mac gave Warning of Java version `WARNING: Java versions >8 are not supported by this SDK`.

# Setting up RStudio
Start off by downloading and unpacking [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) on your computer. Make sure the Hadoop version of Spark is 2.7. Unpack in e.g. `C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\Apache\\Spark`. Make a note of where you unpacked spark.

**Windows users**  
Spark will not work on Windows without WinUtils, which contains Windows binaries for Hadoop. This will require admin privileges. More information can be found [here.](https://datathirst.net/blog/2019/4/20/setup-databricks-connect-on-windows)  Also, make sure that your installation path (includes your username) for Spark does not have a space in it! If it does you can get around it by modifying the Windows registry, which can really screw up your Windows installation! Do this at your own risk! More information can be found [here.](https://datathirst.net/blog/2019/4/20/setup-databricks-connect-on-windows)

Then run the following command to get the path where the pyspark Java archive files are:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
databricks-connect get-jar-dir
```

This will return a path like this 

- Windows: `C:\\users\\username\\appdata\\local\\continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\dbconnect\\lib\\site-packages\\pyspark/jars`

- Mac: `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyspark/jars`

Copy the file path of one directory above the JAR directory file path. For example `C:\\users\\username\\appdata\\local\\continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\dbconnect\\lib\\site-packages\\pyspark`

Now switch over to RStudio. First, install `SparkR` with command `install.packages("SparkR")`. Then copy the two file directory paths and use them to tell SparkR where to look for Spark and pyspark. On a Windows computer backslashes need to be escaped, therefore the double backslashes in the path names. On a Mac computer the path will have front slashes.

In Windows:

```{r}
library(dplyr)

library(SparkR, lib.loc = .libPaths(c(file.path("C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\Apache\\Spark\\Cache\\spark-2.4.3-bin-hadoop2.7", "R", "lib"), .libPaths())))

Sys.setenv(SPARK_HOME = "c:\\users\\ericle\\appdata\\local\\continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\dbconnect_6_2\\lib\\site-packages\\pyspark")
```

In Mac:


```{r}
library(dplyr)

library(SparkR, lib.loc = .libPaths(c(file.path('~/AppData/spark-3.0.0-preview2-bin-hadoop2.7/', 'R', 'lib'), .libPaths())))

Sys.setenv(SPARK_HOME = "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyspark/")
```



You should now be able to initiate a Spark session and start running SparkR commands. If your cluster is not running it should start automatically (this might take some minutes).

```{r}
SparkR::sparkR.session()
```

```{r}
df <- as.DataFrame(faithful)
df1 <- dapply(df, function(x) { x }, schema(df))
collect(df1)
```

```{r}
nba_player_stats <- read.df(source = "csv", path = "dbfs:/FileStore/tables/nbaplayerstats1519_2-d5cfb.csv", header="true", inferSchema = "true", sep = ';')

head(nba_player_stats)
```

You can stop the Spark session but the cluster will not shut down until the preset  autotermination time, or until you terminate it manually.

```{r}
SparkR::sparkR.session.stop()
```


# Troubleshoot

## Mac: Error starting a spark session

In mac starting a new spark session with command `SparkR::sparkR.session()` might give you an error in console:

```
Java version 8 is required for this package; found version: 11.0.1
```

Check installed java version in terminal:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
ls -l /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines
```

Set Java version directory in R before running SparkR session command:

```{r}
Sys.setenv(JAVA_HOME = "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_241.jdk/Contents/Home")
```
